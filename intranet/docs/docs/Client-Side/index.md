# Getting EmbaNET VPN Client Source Code

## what we've doing

We are configuring the local workstation (`GALLARDO`). getting the code from github for one click deploys.

## what you need

You can use any debian/ubuntu based OS.

**Red Hat Servers**: Red Hat won't work here b/c the instalation commands different. Sorry. (not sorry?). just use `yum` equivalents instead of `apt`  for the install scripts.

## clone the project from the softwareshinobi github

```
git clone https://github.com/softwareshinobi/embaNET-private-intranet.git
```
